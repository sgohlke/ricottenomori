  <section>
    <span>As I open my eyes I look up to big trees. 'Where am I? What has happend?' I thought. I look up into the
      sky, but there
      are only big trees above me. But what is this yellow, glittering thing on the ground. As I take a close look I
      notice
      it is a slime.</span><br /><br />

    <span>It is a JellySlime that seems to be interested in me. As I try to move left it seems to follow me. But
      what is this rustle? Suddenly
      two blue creatures jump out of the darkness. What will happen now? Will JellySlime and I be able to beat them?
      Will we find our way out of
      this forrest?</span>
