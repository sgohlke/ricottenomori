        <span>As I open my eyes I look up to big trees. 'Where am I? What has happend?' I thought. I look up into the
          sky, but there
          are only big trees above me. But what is this yellow, glittering thing on the ground. As I take a close look I notice
          it is a slime.</span><br /><br />

        <span>It is a JellySlime that seems to be interested in me. As I try to move left it seems to follow me. But
          what is this rustle? Suddenly
          two blue creatures jump out of the darkness. What will happen now? Will JellySlime and I be able to beat them?
          Will we find our way out of
          this forrest?</span>
